This repository aims to analyze the various deep learning algorithms on the radiography database that could be useful in diagnosing the COVID19 existence. We also discussed recently available datasets around the globe and the application of various DL architectures in the paper. LeNet5, CNN, Dense-Net121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, NasNetMobile, NasNetLarge, InceptionV3, InceptionResnetv2 and Xception were presented with performance measures as a proof of concept. Further, we proposed a method to detect the COVID-19 presence based on the results of the above architectures. X-ray diagnosing can be used as an initial method during large population testing and can be made easily available at any remote place with a good internet connection.
